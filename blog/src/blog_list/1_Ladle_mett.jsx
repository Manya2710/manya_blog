    <p className='text-lg'>
      Ladle Metallurgy is the stage of secondary steelmaking where molten steel, after being tapped from the blast furnace → BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace) or EAF (Electric Arc Furnace), is further refined inside the steel ladle. The ladle is no longer just a “bucket to transfer steel” — it becomes a reactor where the final adjustments to steel’s composition, cleanliness, and temperature are made.

    <p className="dark:text-gray-800 text-xl font-semibold">Why ladle metallurgy is done?</p>
    <ul className='text-md font-medium'>1. Composition Control</ul>
    <p>- Alloying for adjustment of melt chemistry.</p>
    <p>- Powder injection for desulfurization.</p>
    <p>- Vacuum treatment for removal of dissolved gases and production of ultra-low carbon steel.</p>
  <ul className='text-md font-medium'>2. Cleanliness Control</ul>

  <p>- Use of synthetic slag for better inclusion absorption.</p>
  <p>- Engineering of flow in tundish and molds to aid inclusion flotation.</p>
  <p>- Reactive powder injection for modifying the morphology and composition of oxide and sulfide inclusions.</p>
  <ul className='text-md font-medium'>3. Temperature Control</ul>

  <p>- Electrical energy is supplied to increase the heat content of molten steel.</p>
  <p>- Heat is typically produced through arcing in a Ladle Refining Furnace (LRF).</p>
  <p>- Convection and radiation transport heat, raising melt temperature to the desired casting range.</p>

    <p className='dark:text-gray-800 text-xl font-semibold'>Importance in Modern Steelmaking</p>
    <p>Steel today is not just about strength — industries demand clean, precise, and specialized steels for applications ranging from automobiles and construction to aerospace and medical devices. To meet these stringent requirements, primary steelmaking (BOF or EAF) is not enough.</p>

    <p>That’s where Ladle Metallurgy comes in. It ensures:</p>

    <p>✅ High-quality steels with extremely low impurity levels.</p>
    <p>✅ Precise chemical composition, tailored for customer requirements.</p>
    <p>✅ Improved cleanliness, removing non-metallic inclusions.</p>
    <p>✅ Controlled temperature, making casting smoother and defect-free.</p>
    <p>✅ Flexibility, allowing the production of steels with different properties in the same plant.</p>
    <p>In short: Without Ladle Metallurgy, modern steel industries could not deliver the advanced, reliable, and specialized steels that our technology-driven world relies on.</p>
